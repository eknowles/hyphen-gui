Possibly the best GUI for CS:Source.

The GUI is aimed towards providing members of the competitive gaming scene a more beautiful user interface as well as making administrating a game server more easily.

One of my aims was to make an attractive GUI that would be allowed to be used in offical games such as LAN and online leagues such as the ESL.
